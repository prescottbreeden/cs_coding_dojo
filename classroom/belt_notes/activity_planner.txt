Black Belt:
- Special chars in password
- Past date validation
- Don't show past activities
- Conflict detection 

Red Belt:
- everything else?

Notes:
- Conflict detection is a little tough imo for most students
- Time field could be more explicit (avoid students passing in strings)
- The Join button might be worth adding as black belt as it tends to be one
  of those things that is tough for students to visualize under stress even
  if it's the exact logic used on the dashboard view.
